# FileDownloadR

Manage downloadable files without revealing the file url.

## Features

This MODX-Extra can be used to display a list of files from a directory. The
download link for each file is hashed. This way the full URL of the file is not
displayed and the files/directories can be located outside the webroot. Each
file can also be assigned a download counter and extended fields, which are
stored in a custom database table.

An upload form can be used to upload files to a directory on the server.

## Installation
