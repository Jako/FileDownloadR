# FileDownloadR

Manage downloadable files without revealing the file url.

### Requirements

* MODX Revolution 2.8+
* PHP 7.4+

### Features

This MODX-Extra can be used to display a list of files from a directory. The
download link for each file is hashed. This way the full URL of the file is not
displayed and the files/directories can be located outside the webroot. Each
file can also be assigned a download counter and extended fields, which are
stored in a custom database table. A single file can be uploaded using an upload
form.
