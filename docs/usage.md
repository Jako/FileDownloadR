## Extended File Fields

The extended file fields can be defined in the MODX system setting
`filedownloadr.extended_file_fields` with a JSON-encoded array. The following
code contains an example for a description field. The type can be set to `bool`,
`int` and `string`. The default type is `string`.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "description",
    "type": "text"
  }
]
```

The fields can be set when uploading a file via an input field or via a plugin.
The input field must be set in the upload form with the prefix `fdextended_`.
The value of the extended file field will appear in the file list in the
placeholder with the prefix `fd.extended.`. In the example chunks, this is shown
for the extended field `description`.
